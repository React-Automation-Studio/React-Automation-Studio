When creating more complex layouts or mobile layouts we recommend you stack the grid as a column of rows. This ensures that each row expands to the height of the highest component in that row. This is illustrated below.

```js
{/*Viewing width set to 40% to illustrate mobile screen viewing port*/}
  <div style={{width:"40%"}}>
    <Mobile/>
  </div>
```
