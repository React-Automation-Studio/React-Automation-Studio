In this example the TextOutput component displays the raw contents of a waveform PV.

Reading a binary waveform of 10 elements.

By default the ArrayContainer shows only 10 elements per time but this value can be changed.

The ArrayContainer does not know how many items there are in the PV value. For this reason it expects a props with the array length. By default the maxItemsCount is 100

# Usage

## Example1

<Story of={ArrayContainer.Example1} />

## Example2

By default this component shows only ten items per time. Users can choose how many items they want to see per time. Obviously this value can't be greater than maxItemsCount.

When not all the items are visible the registersLabel props is useful to add a label to each element. This value overrides the value given to the `label` props of (in our case) `TextInput`.

<Story of={ArrayContainer.Example2} />

## Example3

In some cases users want to show or consider only a subset of the array values. In this case we use `registers`. Items order in the `registers` prop does count!

When specifying the registers values, the `maxItemsCount` is overridden with the length of the array given to `registers`; in these cases `maxItemsCount can be overridden`. Instead the visibleItemsCount can be specified. If not the component shows all the elements given into the array.

<Story of={ArrayContainer.Example3} />

## Example4

Horizontal direction without and with minimum width for each item

<Story of={ArrayContainer.Example4} />

## Example5

Add a label on the ArrayContainer component and add spacing between items
