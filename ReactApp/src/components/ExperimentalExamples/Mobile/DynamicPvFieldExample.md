When using EPICS, the RAS pv's metadata is conventionally derived from the pyEpics PV in the pvserver. 
The pyEpics metadata is unfortunately static and the values used will be the intial values that pvserver receives when it connects the first time. 
This is sufficient in most cases except when the user wants to dynamically update the metaData.
In this case a direct connection can be made to all the pv fields by setting useMetadata to false. 
If any of the metadata pvs are defined i.e unitsPv then the PV makes a new data  connection to this alternate pv and will
use the value provided by this pv as the units. 
The same is the case for the precPV, labelPv, alarmPv, unitsPv and minPv.
By setting useMetadata to false also enables connection to other variables as defined by different protocols.

In the case of EPICS protcol with useMetadata=false, the metaData pvs do not need to be defined and the PV compoment will automatically connect to the relevant fields.

The Example below shows a TextInput and a Slider component on the left with useMetadata=true, and on the right with useMetadata=false.
In the useMetadata=false case, seperate variables passively write to the EPICS fields in AO component. You will notice that the context menu show all the extra connections made.
