The system is by default configured to serve the socket connections and client webserver over HTTP on localhost.

To enable secure login and installation as a PWA, a certificate and key needs to be installed that is bound to your hostname and the .env environment variables need to be edited to serve overs HTTPS and via the correct hostname.

Inside the React Automation Studio installation folder:

```bash
ls .env
```
If it exists edit the .env file, otherwise copy example.env to .env and set

```bash

REACT_APP_PyEpicsServerBASEURL=https://customURL
REACT_APP_EnableLogin=false
REACT_APP_FrontendServerPORT=9000
REACT_APP_PyEpicsServerPORT=5000
REACT_APP_PyEpicsServerStyleguidePORT=5001
REACT_APP_StyleguideServerPORT=6060
REACT_APP_EnableLoginStyleguide=false
```
to https and the correct hostname

The certificates need to be placed in the the React Automation Studio installation folder under the certificates folder.

The certificate needs to be called: server.cer And the key needs to be called: server.key The .gitignore will prevent them from being copied to the repository



The pvServer and node development environment, will need to be restarted, and the production environments will need to be rebuilt.

Both the pvServer and the node clientserver will automatically detect the change.

The built client will be then served  https://customURL:9000/, the styleguide at https://customURL:6060/ and the dev client at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ or http://hostip:3000/
