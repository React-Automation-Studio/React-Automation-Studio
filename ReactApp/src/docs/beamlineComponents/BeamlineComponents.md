We are currently in the progress of migrating iThemba LABS svg based beamline components to site independant components based on the widget component.

when this is complete then the beamline control system demos will be updated to use these components.

This section is only for preview.

Recipe to 3d perspective component:
<ol>
<li>In Inkscape create document with canvas size 50x50 px</li>
<li> Set the units to px</li>
<li> Create a mock beam line 10V, 50W, Centered at 0X 25Y</li>

<li>Draw the front face fo the component.</li>
<li>Rotate the face 15 degrees clockwise</li>
<li>Scale the face width to 30%</li>
<li>Copy the face</li>
<li>Offset it to the right by 20 pixels or so</li>
<li>Join the vertices by creating closed paths</li>
<li>Create a cut out on the front face for the beam pipe</li>
<li> Save the file</li>
<li> open it in a text editor and copy all the text</li>
<li> go to: https://react-svgr.com/playground/ and paste the text in svg input container</li>
<li> copy the jsx output</li>
<li> insert it in your own custom component or as child of the SvgComponent</li>
<li> remove unnecessary props and fills</li>
</ol>
