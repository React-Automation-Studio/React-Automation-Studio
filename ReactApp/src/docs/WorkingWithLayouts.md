The next sections lists all the layout wrapper components that can be used in React-Automation-Studio.

A layout wrapper is intended to wrap content to provide a consistent look and feel across all interfaces.

React-Automation-Studio currently only contains one layout wrapper component - TradionalLayout. This wraps content with an appbar, footer and sidedrawers. All these features are customisable.

Usage examples and properties for the component is given. The contents of the wrapper components are interactive with the Demo IOC.

Note 1: The appbar and footer will encapsulate the entire window when used outside of the styleguide.

Note 2: The Home, Logout, and ToggleTheme drawer items are active (will trigger) when used outside of the styleguide.
