The AlarmHandler component is built on a React Automation Studio based front end that connects to an alarm server back end.

The alarm server is written in Python and makes use of a MongoDB database to persist and archive alarm data. The alarm server must be configured correctly before connecting it to the AlarmHandler component on the front end.
