The Widget component creates standard properties, state variables and callbacks to manage the behaviour of a component communicating with one or multiple PVs. It also provides the default RAS context Menu to the child component. The props that are fowarded to the child component are detailed in the table in the Widget, and the Widget's props are detailed in the props&methods section.
