*Note this document is a work in progress*

This document describes a minimal set of manual end-to-end tests that should be performed and verified to work before creating a new release.

The .env file in the project root folder is used to enable features. To simplify the repetition  of the manual testing process it is encouraged to clone the repository into multiple folders to create an individual .env that turns on separate features.

*Prerequisites:* 

Bring up the demo archiver: https://github.com/React-Automation-Studio/React-Automation-Studio-Demo-Archiver



# Scenario 1: Bringing up the system with default parameters

Test the default build for an empty .env file.

##  Production build
Bring up the compose environment:
```
docker compose  up
```
  Checklist

- [ ] check version numbers are correct
- [ ] verify all the widgets work
- [ ] verify all the demos work
- [ ] refresh the browser (use ctrl+f5) repeatedly and verify the widgets connect to their corresponding PVs
- [ ] switch between tabs/menu and verify the widgets reconnect to their corresponding PVs every time
- [ ] verify archiver demo works
- [ ] verify alarm handler demo works - note you need authentication enabled to verify all the advanced features
- [ ] verify styleguide works and that all the demo widgets work correctly in the styleguide

##  Dev build
Bring up the compose environment:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```
  Checklist

- [ ] verify that no errors are reported to the web apps console whilst perform the above checks
- [ ] verify styleguide works and that all the demo widgets work correctly in the styleguide
- [ ] verify that no errors are reported to the web apps console whilst performing the above checks in the styleguide

##  Styleguide dev build

docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

# Scenario 2: Test the build with authentication and https enabled

Setup the environment with authentication and https enabled:

Example .env:

```
SERVER_PORT=5000
SECURE=true
HTTP_REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS=true
REACT_APP_EnableLogin=true

```

- [ ] Repeat the tests in the scenario 1.

## Additional tests:
- [ ] log in and log out multiple times using the admin user
- [ ] add a test user, make sure the user only has readonly access by default.
- [ ] log in and out repetitively with the test user 
- [ ] allow write access to a PV by the test user, using the test user refresh the browser and verify the test user can write to the PV

# Scenario 3: Verify production build over HTTPS using standard ports

Change the .env so that the website is served over port 443


```
SERVER_PORT=443
SECURE=true
HTTP_REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS=true
REACT_APP_EnableLogin=true

```
-[ ] make sure the webapp is served over over https at the address: https://localhost
-[ ] verify that a user can login and out
-[ ] verify demos are working



# Scenario 4: Alarm handler tests
Alarm handler tests.

-[ ] verify alarmhandler is working

* This will be expanded in future*

# Scenario 5: Alternate authentication tests
Test alternative authentication mechanisms
* This will be expanded in future*
-[ ] verify Google authentication is working
-[ ] verify LDAP authentication is working
