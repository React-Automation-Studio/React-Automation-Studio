This user guide focuses on the alarm handler user interface (AlarmHandler component) and the functionality it provides to the user. The AlarmHandler component must be connected to an alarm server backend. It is assumed that the user has deployed the alarm server correctly as per the alarm server setup guide.

The alarm handler is provided with some demo pvs that have preset alarm levels and severities. To toggle or change the values of these demo pvs, make use of the the **[BEAM LINE CONTROL DEMO]** and **[VAULT DEMO]** pages which can be found on the React Automation Studio home page.
