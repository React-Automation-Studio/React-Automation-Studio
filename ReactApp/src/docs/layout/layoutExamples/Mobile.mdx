# Mobile Layout
When creating more complex layouts or mobile layouts we recommend you stack the grid as a column of rows. This ensures that each row expands to the height of the highest component in that row. This is illustrated below.
<ImportPath libName={"src"} />
<Story of={MobileStories.Primary} />
